# How to play Wordle

Wordle is a fun game that challenges you to guess a word that the computer has randomly generated.  Millions of people play this game through [New York Times](https://www.https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and share their results on social media.  I chose this game because I play it every day and love it!

You will enter letters using the on-screen keyboard.  If the square turns green, you have the correct letter in the correct space.  If the square turns peach, you have a letter that is in the word, but not in the correct space.  If the square doesn't change color, the letter is not in the word.

You have six chances to enter words.  If you match the computer's word, you win the game!  If you enter six words and still haven't guessed the word, you lose.
